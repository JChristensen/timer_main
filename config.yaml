# YAML configuration file for remote timers.
#
# Each timer is denoted by a unique name starting in column 1.
# Each timer has the following properties. Property names must be lower case:
#   sched   - A list of lists, denoting on/off times and days. Details below.
#   enabled - Optional true or false; defaults to true if not given,
#             case insensitive.
#   random  - Optional integer; defaults to zero if not given.
#             This is the maximum number of minutes the time may be adjusted
#             to give a "lived-in" look when timing lights. A different
#             random adjustment is calculated daily.
#             The random feature is not implemented yet.
#
# Each sched sub-list consists of three positional items, in this order:
#   Time  - A 24-hour time, represented as an integer, hhmm, without
#           a colon. Do not use leading zeros; this will cause the time
#           to be interpreted as octal!
#   State - On, off, true or false. Case insensitive.
#   Days  - A space-separated list of days giving the days the schedule
#           item is effective. Case insensitive.
#           Allowed values are sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, all,
#           weekdays and weekends. Other values are silently ignored.
